# Claude Code Transcripts - Public

Public transcripts of selected Claude Code sessions, showcasing development workflows and problem-solving approaches.

## What's Here

This repository contains curated HTML transcripts from selected Claude Code sessions. Projects are explicitly designated for public sharing using `.public` marker files in their source directories.

## How Projects Become Public

Only projects with a `.public` marker file in their source directory are included here. This ensures intentional, safe sharing of transcripts while keeping all other projects private.

See the main [claude-transcripts](https://github.com/ludaesch/claude-transcripts) repository (private) for the complete archive.
